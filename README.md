## Genetic algorithm

Curve fitting is a well researched problem. There are few approaches that use 
genetic algorithms for curve fitting. We try a new approach to curve fitting 
where we don't focus on performance but rather try to create "real" equations.
This differs from the traditional approach, where parameters of a harmonic function
are varied to produce a specific curve. 

The visualization is written in D3 and javascript; however, the server and genetic
algorithm are written entirely in clojure. 

## Examples 

### Generated by code

For  goal graph - blue is randomly generated, red is our match.
![An example graph](./example1.png "First example")

### Generated by code 

For  goal graph - blue is randomly generated, red is our match.
![An example graph](./example2.png "First example")

## Setup and run

```
lein run -m myapp.core
```

Then navigate your browser to localhost:5000 to see some graphs
